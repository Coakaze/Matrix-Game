# Tetris

## Backstory
I chose to create this game because it is a fun old school game, that almost everyone has played and knows its rules. It was a great challenge developing my first embedded project, even if I had a hard time figuring out how to actually make it.

## Implementation Detail
When we first start the project, a greeting message is displayed for 4 seconds. Atfer that the menu appears and with the joystick you can navigate through it. The menu follows the lower schema:
  - Start Game: starting the game
  - Highscore: showing the first 3 best scores ever made.
  - Settings: here you can change you nickname and set the game difficulty
  - About: informations about the game and the author with a github link
